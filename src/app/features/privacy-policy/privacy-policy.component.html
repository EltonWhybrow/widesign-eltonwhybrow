      Privacy policy
      Who we are
      Our website address is: https://staging.redhilltutoring.co.uk

      Comments
      When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP
      address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

      An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service
      to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
      https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in
      the context of your comment.

      Media
      If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS)
      included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

      Who we share your data with
      If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.

      How long we retain your data
      If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and
      approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

      What rights you have over your data
      If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the
      personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase
      any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative,
      legal, or security purposes.

      Where we send your data
      Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

      Cookie policy
      If you login or leave comments
      If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These
      are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment.
      These cookies will last for one year.

      If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This
      cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
