    <h3 class="bg-tealy-500 p-2 text-white inline-block text-xl mb-2 font-serif">Brief History</h3>
    <p class="standard-paragraph">
      I grew up a 80-90's Skateboarder riding all over London spots having the best time, meeting tons of people from
      different backgrounds living the Southbank dream. Ended up being one of the original sponsored skaters on the FLIP
      Skateboard team when they formed in London many moons ago. Happy
      times.
    </p>
    <p class="standard-paragraph">
      After my Skating years, I worked in the food industry for a while and trained with a Chef who once made a cake for
      the Queen (I believe it was her birthday cake), so I consider myself quite accomplished in the kitchen. Whilst in
      the food industry I began learning to code and built up my skill level progressively until I was ready to move
      into web design full-time. More recently, I have taken to the guitar to quelch my ever lasting thirst to learn new
      things.
    </p>
    <p class="standard-paragraph">
      Current day job is designing, developing and maintaining applications for a growing telematics insurance firm.
