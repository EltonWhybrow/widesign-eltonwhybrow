    <h3 class="heading-3">Brief History</h3>
    <p class="standard-paragraph font-bold">
      I grew up in the 80's Skateboarder all over famous London skate spots having the best time, meeting tons of people
      from
      different backgrounds living the Southbank dream. Ended up being one of the original sponsored skaters on the FLIP
      Skateboard team when they formed in London many moons ago...
    </p>
    <p class="standard-paragraph">
      After my Skating years, I worked in the food industry for a while and trained with a Chef who once made a cake for
      the Queen (I believe it was her birthday cake), so I consider myself quite accomplished in the kitchen. Whilst in
      the food industry I began learning to code and built up my skill level progressively until I was ready to move
      into web design full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="standard-paragraph">
      Current day job is designing, developing and maintaining applications for a growing telematics insurance firm.
      You can always check out my socials if your that way inclined.
    </p>
    <p class="standard-paragraph font-semibold">
      That's more than enough about me...
